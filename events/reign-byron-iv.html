<p>Byron IV's reign was short for some and long for others. 
The fact most noted by history is that his death lead with some directness
toward the succession struggle now termed <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xCAzZadyyspk4Sl0WLGpu9kZdYYcX2eV36ipV2frbuQ/edit#heading=h.emw23ue39ay7">the Indigo and Violet War</a>.
While Byron himself certainly had nothing to do with those most unfortunate 
happenings, his lack of clarity about his intended heir contributed.</p>
